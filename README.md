# MyReads Project
This applications works like a "virtual" bookshelf. It allows you to keep track of what books you are currently reading, want to read, and have read. When you "move" the book from one "shelf" to another it saves your changes through an API.

You can also search for books and add a book to your bookshelf. Any book you added to the bookshelf from the search page is saved to the bookshelf permanently, even when you revisit the site after closing it.

This is my submission of the assessment project for Udacity's React fundamentals course. My submission is a fork of the starter project hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter)
